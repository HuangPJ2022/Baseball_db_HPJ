What'll be the pitch when it's 3-0 count in a baseball game? What is the pitcher thinking? <br>
If it's a strike, what factor dominates pithcers' minds or umpires' judgement?

In this project, I scraped data from baseball savant(https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/), using ML models to analyze the problem and train a prediction model.
As a result, I found several intriguing factors. More importantly, my prediction model made 100% precision rate.

All my research data and code have been posted on this repos. If you're interested in my research, you can take a look at my report **HPJ0618.pdf**. Any suggestion or advice just email me(hpj707024@gmail.com). Thanks!!
